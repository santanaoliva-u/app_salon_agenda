## Important Notes

1. **Google Maps API Key**: You still need to replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE` in the AndroidManifest.xml with your actual Google Maps API key.

2. **Application ID**: The application ID has been changed to `com.webboostmarketing.salonbelleza` throughout the configuration.

3. **Firebase Integration**: Firebase is properly configured with the google-services plugin and BOM dependency management.

4. **Compatibility**: All configurations are now aligned with modern Flutter and Android standards.

## Verification Steps

To verify that the fixes work correctly:

1. Run `flutter pub get` to ensure all dependencies are up to date
2. Run `flutter build apk` to test the Android build
3. Make sure to add your actual Google Maps API key to the AndroidManifest.xml
4. Test the app on a physical device or emulator

The configuration should now be error-free and ready for building and deployment.
